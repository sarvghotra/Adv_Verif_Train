Reward I:
Human: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?
Assistant: Step 1: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, so the amount of fiber required is 2.
Step 2: It also takes half the amount of fiber as white fiber. Half of 2 is 1, so the amount of white fiber is 1.
Step 3: To find the total amount, we add the amount of blue and white fibers. 2+1 = 3.
The final answer is 3
